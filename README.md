## Project status
We are currently working on our prototype.
Thus, Eranity is currently under development, but you may visit us at https://eranity.herokuapp.com


## About Us
ERAN provides Lifesaving Emotional First Aid Services, offering initial response and emotional support on the phone and online, while maintaining strict confidentiality and anonymity.
During the spread of COVID-19, especially in 2021, and even nowadays,
the need for ERAN services has been increasing drastically. 
The recent load has caused a spike in service abandonment percentage.

That is why we have been creating Eranity - the virtual community of ERAN.
Eranity users. Eranity may decrease load on ERAN volunteers and services, while allowing members to express their deepest feelings,
in a safe, and anonymus space.

## Product Description
Eranity allows members to log into an account, and track their mood and feelings.
While using the web application, members of the community may choose their current feelings and emotions, whenever they log into their account.
In addition, users can also upload a daily diary, depicting their thoughts and emotions.

Users may choose how private they will to be. When logging in or creating an account, members may choose a new nickname, and change it whenever they want.
Moreover, when writing in their diary, users may choose to share their feelings with the community or leave what they have written to themselves.

However, sometimes there is a need for urgent help.
Eranity knows how to identify a true need for crucial help, and redirect the user for the suitable ERAN service.

## Technology
